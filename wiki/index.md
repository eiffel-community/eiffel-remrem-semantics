## Introduction

Eiffel REMReM Semantics is a set of protocol defined messages that contains templates and schemas for Eiffel message types. It implements the Eiffel REMReM Protocol Interface. Eiffel REMReM Semantics is used to check, generate and validate Eiffel messages. This project contains JSON schemas to validate JSON message to met the Eiffel protocol. Semantics generate Eiffel events from both [Eiffel Protocol](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-remrem-protocol-interface) and [Operations Extension](https://github.com/Ericsson/eiffel-operations-extension).
This project contains information about how to form a routing key that will be added to the generated message.

Refer [Installation](installation.md) and [Usage](usage.md) links for more information on REMReM-Semantics.
